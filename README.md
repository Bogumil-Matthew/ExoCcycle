# ExoCcycle
A python based library for creating exoplanetary-like bathymetry models and conducting carbon cycle analyses with bathymetry models.

Currently, a primarily component of this library are its class/methods/functions for objectively finding communities on the sphere of an input spherical shell. These methods are useful for define current, paleo-, and exo- ocean basins for use in and constructing intermediate C cycle models. However, there are additional domains of study that can readily make use of community detection of single or multiple fields on the spherical shells.

There are jupiter notebooks within the JN folder. After dowloading/cloning this library, open the GMD_Manuscript_Figures.ipynb to see example of how this library can be used.
